# Ranking of Computer Memory from Fastest to Slowest

1. **Registers**
   - Fastest memory, located within the CPU.
   - Used for temporary storage of small amounts of data and immediate computations.

2. **L1 Cache**
   - Level 1 cache, closest to the CPU cores.
   - Very fast but limited in size (typically a few kilobytes).

3. **L2 Cache**
   - Level 2 cache, larger than L1 but slower.
   - Still much faster than main memory (typically hundreds of kilobytes).

4. **L3 Cache**
   - Level 3 cache, shared among cores in multicore processors.
   - Larger than L2 (typically several megabytes) but slower.

5. **RAM (Main Memory)**
   - Dynamic RAM (DRAM), used for general-purpose memory in computers.
   - Slower than cache but larger in capacity (typically gigabytes).

6. **SSD (Solid State Drive)**
   - Non-volatile storage with faster access times than HDDs.
   - Typically used for operating systems and applications.

7. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
   - Mechanical storage device, slower access times compared to SSDs.
   - Larger storage capacity at a lower cost.

8. **Optical Storage (CDs, DVDs)**
   - Used for media distribution and long-term storage.
   - Slower access times compared to HDDs and SSDs.

9. **Tape Storage**
   - Used for archival storage and backup.
   - Slowest access times; typically requires sequential access to retrieve data.



# Data Structures Targeting Different Memory Types

1. **Registers**
   - **Data Structures**: 
     - Primitive data types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`)
     - Temporary variables (e.g., loop counters, intermediate results)
     - Small arrays for quick calculations

2. **L1 Cache**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Small arrays (e.g., for matrix calculations)
     - Loops and iterations (spatial locality)
     - Cache-optimized data structures (e.g., cache-aware algorithms)
     - Small structs or objects that fit within the cache line

3. **L2 Cache**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Larger arrays (e.g., multi-dimensional arrays)
     - Dynamic arrays (e.g., `std::vector`)
     - Hash tables with efficient key distributions
     - B-trees and other tree structures that minimize cache misses

4. **L3 Cache**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Larger collections of data (e.g., graphs, trees)
     - Caches for data-heavy applications (e.g., databases)
     - Objects with locality of reference, allowing for efficient loading into cache

5. **RAM (Main Memory)**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Linked lists
     - Trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees)
     - Hash tables
     - Graphs and complex data structures that require dynamic resizing
     - Heaps (for priority queues)

6. **SSD (Solid State Drive)**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - B-trees and B+ trees for database indexing
     - Log-structured merge trees (LSM trees) for write-heavy applications
     - Filesystems managing hierarchical data (e.g., ext4, NTFS)
     - Bloom filters for quick existence checks

7. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - B-trees and B+ trees for database storage
     - File systems to organize files (e.g., FAT32, NTFS)
     - External sorting algorithms for handling large datasets

8. **Optical Storage (CDs, DVDs)**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Read-only data structures (e.g., static lookup tables)
     - File systems optimized for sequential access (e.g., ISO 9660)
     - Media formats for audio and video (e.g., MPEG, JPEG)

9. **Tape Storage**
   - **Data Structures**:
     - Sequential data structures (e.g., log files)
     - Backup systems for archival data
     - Hierarchical storage management (HSM) systems for long-term data retention
